        <h1>Step 3: Getting the Equipment Required</h1>
        <img src="keyboardparts.jpg" alt="Keyboard Parts" width="450" height="300">
      
        <p>This section can be a bit overwhelming, since there is a lot of stuff you can get to do the job.</p>
        <p>This custom keyboard checklist can make this part considerably easier so you can keep track of all the equipment required.</p>
      
        <p><b>Below are the basic tools required.</b></p>
      
        <h2>Essential Tools - You NEED These</h2>
      
        <p><b>Adjustable Soldering Iron: TS100</b> The TS100 is great for soldering switches on as well as helping you desolder switches in case mistakes are made. This is essential unless you have a hot-swappable board. It’s extremely portable and has a temperature reading screen.</p>
        <p><b>Solder Sucker: Engineer SS-02</b> The Engineer SS-02 is easy to use, easy to maintain, doesn’t break the bank, and helps in those moments when you know you messed up.</p>
        <p><b>Solder Wire: Kester 63/37 SN/PB</b> Solder is essential. Having lead solder makes it much easier to desolder switches. It’s a good size and easy to store when not in use.</p>
        <p><b>Switch Puller: Antistatic Extractor Tool</b> Much easier to use than the metal switch pullers you get with hot-swappable boards. And it comes in a pack or two, so you can do keyboard-related work in more than one place. Also don’t worry about misplacing one.</p>
        <p><b>Precision Screwdriver Kit</b> Having a screwdriver kit with different bit varieties will come in handy when opening up cases, opening up switches without a switch opener, and putting your keyboard together.</p>
        <p><b>Wire Keycap Puller</b> A wire keycap puller won’t scratch your keycaps and will let you change keycaps quickly without trying to manhandle them with your fingers.</p>
      
        <h2>Nice Tools to Have (Makes Life a LOT Easier)</h2>
      
        <p><b>Soldering Stand</b> Keeps you safe when your soldering iron is not in use, highly recommended despite not being essential. Also comes with a place to clean your soldering iron’s tip.</p>
        <p><b>Heat Insulated Mat</b> If you’re working on a surface that can be burned or unprotected, this mat is highly recommended. The soldering iron’s temperature usually exceeds 300 degrees Celsius. It also keeps all of your screws and small materials in an easily accessible space.</p>
        <p><b>USB Cables</b> Having a USB cable that can fit multiple different ports is extra convenient, especially one that is stylish and matches your setup.</p>
        <p><b>Magnetic Holding Trays</b> This might seem a little extra, but when you’re dealing with small little screws that could roll around and get lost in the cracks, this will be a lifesaver.</p>
      
        <h2>Tools for Lubing & Filming Switches</h2>
      
        <p><b>Switch Opener</b> Having a switch opener makes your life a million times easier and saves time too. Rather than breaking your nails trying to open each one, just press each switch and then separate them. Easy peasy.</p>
        <p><b>Switch Films</b> Switch films help tighten up your switches and prevent switch wobble, which makes them sound and feel crispy and thocc-y.</p>
        <p><b>Switch Lube for Switches</b> Having the right switch lube makes the job much easier. For the type of lube, 205g0 is a great all-around lube for linear and tactile switches. This is usually a more viscous lube.</p>
        <p><b>Lube for Bag Lubing Springs</b> Springs are much easier to lube via throwing them in a bag with a few drops of lube in it. Then shake it all around. You need a thin lube for this.</p>
        <p><b>Ziploc Bags</b> To bag lube, you need bags. These bags fasten to a close and let you shake all of the springs around without worrying about any blowouts, because that could get messy real fast.</p>
        <p><b>Paintbrushes</b> Size 00 is perfect for reaching all of the crevices to lube your switches. There’s enough to lube switches for many years, and they are reusable if you wash them thoroughly enough.</p>
        <p><b>Antistatic Tweezers</b> Having a nice pair of tweezers lets you pick up the springs easier without lubing up your fingers in the process. Tweezers are always handy when dealing with tiny objects.</p>
        <p><b>Pronged Pick-up Tool</b> If you got clumsy fingers, this tool makes lubing the switch stems much easier. Pick them up, then spin the stem as you lube it without worrying about your fingers or dropping it.</p>
      
        <h2>Tools for Modding Stabilizers</h2>
        
        <p><b>Fabric Bandaids</b> These are great for the bandaid mod and to protect your fingers in case you get cuts.</p>
        <p><b>Flush Cutters</b> Great for clipping the small feet of your stabilizers as well as serve as a wire cutter for adding LEDs onto your keyboard or working on through-hole builds</p>
        <p><b>Stabilizers Lube</b> Stabilizers need a thicker lubricant, usually Krytox 205g0 is used. Adds extra smoothness to your stabs, making them sound and feel much better.</p>
        <p><b>Scissors</b> A reliable pair of scissors to cut your fabric and to open boxes and packages.</p>
